18 Aug: <> please put your concerns here. I will check as soon as i see text here.  
18 Aug :<sthita> please run fetchmulti.sh in your environment and check the output.Please use the cmd mentioned in usage.  
18 Aug :<sthita> Added fetchmulti.sh file to demonstrate multiple nodes.Edited fetchadminlog.sh which are now working fine in playground.  

17 Aug : Added lines in fetchadminlog.sh to take care of inaccessible nodes.Since can not really test in my environment.Please try in your env and get back.    
16 Aug :The file that was causing issue was termination.log not audit.log . termination.log is not a JSON file.Now script is fully ready.    

# Get all Audit logs for Admin user  
sh fetchAdminlog.sh 2>&1 | tee  adminlogs$(date "+%y%m%d_%H%M%S").log >> /dev/null  

This just outputs the admin logs in below JSON format.
